**Last Updated:** January 1, 2025

## 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By accessing or using the Neon Nexus gaming platform ("Service," "Platform," "we," "us," or "our"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms," "Agreement"). **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.**

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Neon Nexus Hub LLC. By clicking "I Accept," creating an account, or using our Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.

## 2. ELIGIBILITY AND AGE REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Minimum Age
You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Service. If you are under 18, you represent that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the Service.

### 2.2 Age Verification
We reserve the right to request proof of age at any time. Providing false information about your age may result in immediate account termination.

### 2.3 Parental Consent
Parents and guardians of users under 18 are responsible for monitoring their child's use of the Service.

## 3. LICENSE AND OWNERSHIP

### 3.1 Limited License
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use.

### 3.2 Our Intellectual Property
All content, features, functionality, software, code, designs, graphics, logos, and trademarks on the Platform are owned by Neon Nexus Hub or our licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and other intellectual property laws.

### 3.3 User-Generated Content
You retain ownership of content you create or upload ("User Content"), but you grant us a **worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display your User Content in connection with operating, promoting, and improving the Service, and for any other business purpose, including sale or transfer of the company.

**Legal Rationale:** This broad license is essential for platform operations, marketing, analytics, data monetization, and corporate transactions. It survives account termination and company sale.

## 4. USER ACCOUNTS

### 4.1 Account Creation
You must provide accurate, complete, and current information during registration. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

### 4.2 Account Security
You are solely responsible for all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access.

### 4.3 Account Termination
We may suspend or terminate your account at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice, including for violation of these Terms.

## 5. USER CONDUCT AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

You agree NOT to:

- Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any laws
- Harass, threaten, or harm other users
- Impersonate any person or entity
- Post false, misleading, or defamatory content
- Upload viruses, malware, or harmful code
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems
- Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) without permission
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service
- Engage in cheating, hacking, or exploiting game mechanics
- Sell, trade, or transfer accounts or virtual items for real money (unless authorized)
- Collect user data without consent
- Violate any third-party rights

**Violation of these rules may result in immediate account termination, forfeiture of virtual items, and potential legal action.**

## 6. VIRTUAL CURRENCY, XP, AND REWARDS

### 6.1 No Real-World Value
XP, points, badges, virtual items, and all digital assets earned or purchased on the Platform ("Virtual Items") **have no real-world monetary value**. They cannot be exchanged for cash or legal tender.

### 6.2 No Refunds
Purchases of Virtual Items or premium features are **final and non-refundable**, except as required by law.

### 6.3 Modification or Elimination
We reserve the right to modify, eliminate, or adjust the value or availability of Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice.

### 6.4 Forfeiture
Upon account termination (by you or us), you forfeit all Virtual Items, XP, and rewards without compensation.

**Legal Rationale:** These clauses protect against claims that virtual currencies are securities or have monetary value, limiting liability for game economy changes.

## 7. CONTENT MODERATION

### 7.1 Right to Remove Content
We reserve the right to review, monitor, edit, or remove any User Content at any time, for any reason, without notice.

### 7.2 No Obligation
We are not obligated to monitor content but may do so to enforce these Terms, comply with legal obligations, or protect our rights.

### 7.3 Reporting
Users may report violations. We will investigate and take appropriate action in our sole discretion.

## 8. PRIVACY AND DATA USE

### 8.1 Privacy Policy
Your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and share your information.

### 8.2 Data Rights
By using the Service, you grant us the right to:

- Collect, process, and analyze your usage data
- Aggregate and anonymize your data for analytics
- **Sell, license, or monetize aggregated or anonymized data**
- Share data with third parties for business purposes
- Use data to train AI and machine learning models
- Retain data as necessary for legal compliance

### 8.3 No Privacy Expectation
User Content you post publicly has no expectation of privacy. We may use it for marketing and promotional purposes.

**Legal Rationale:** Explicit data monetization rights are essential for business valuation and acquisition. Anonymization protects privacy while preserving commercial value.

## 9. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Service may integrate with third-party services (authentication providers, analytics, payment processors). Your use of these services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party practices.

## 10. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### 10.1 "AS IS" SERVICE
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS." **WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED**, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or reliability.

### 10.2 No Guarantees
We do not guarantee that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free
- Data will be accurate or preserved
- Defects will be corrected
- The Service will meet your expectations

### 10.3 Limitation of Liability
**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:**

- **ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES**
- Loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill
- Service interruptions or downtime
- User errors or deleted accounts
- Third-party actions or content

**OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.**

### 10.4 Jurisdictional Limitations
Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or liability. In such cases, the above limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**Legal Rationale:** These clauses are critical for limiting exposure in lawsuits. Courts generally enforce these if conspicuously presented (which our clickwrap format ensures).

## 11. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless** Neon Nexus Hub, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from:

- Your violation of these Terms
- Your User Content
- Your use of the Service
- Your violation of any law or third-party rights

**Legal Rationale:** Indemnification shifts liability to users for their own misconduct, protecting the company from lawsuits stemming from user behavior.

## 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

### 12.1 MANDATORY ARBITRATION
**READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.**

**Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved by binding arbitration**, rather than in court, except that:

- You may bring claims in small claims court if they qualify
- Either party may seek injunctive relief for intellectual property violations

### 12.2 Arbitration Rules
Arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** or similar body. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding.

### 12.3 CLASS ACTION WAIVER
**YOU AND NEON NEXUS HUB AGREE THAT DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.**

### 12.4 Opt-Out Right
You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by emailing legal@neonnexus.com within 30 days of account creation.

**Legal Rationale:** Arbitration clauses and class action waivers are enforceable (AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion) and significantly reduce litigation costs and class action exposure, making the company more attractive to acquirers.

## 13. TERMINATION

### 13.1 Termination by You
You may terminate your account at any time through account settings or by contacting support.

### 13.2 Termination by Us
We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without notice, for any reason, including:

- Violation of these Terms
- Fraudulent or illegal activity
- Extended inactivity
- Business reasons

### 13.3 Effect of Termination
Upon termination:

- Your license to use the Service ends immediately
- You forfeit all Virtual Items and progress
- We may delete your User Content (but we retain license rights)
- Sections 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 15 survive termination

## 14. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. **Material changes will require your re-acceptance.** Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

We will notify you of material changes via email or in-app notification.

## 15. ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

You may not transfer or assign your account or these Terms without our consent.

**We may freely assign these Terms and transfer our rights and obligations in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or other corporate transaction without your consent.**

**Legal Rationale:** This clause is CRITICAL for acquisition. It allows the company and its assets (including user agreements and data rights) to be sold without requiring individual user re-consent.

## 16. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of **Delaware**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Any disputes not subject to arbitration shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

## 17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Neon Nexus Hub and supersede all prior agreements.

## 18. SEVERABILITY

If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.

## 19. NO WAIVER

Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not waive our right to enforce it later.

## 20. CONTACT INFORMATION
